The json should include 'reason' explaining your solution and 'plan' containing the PDDL format plan. The plan should only include the sequence of actions.\n\nYour response should look exactly like this:\n$$\n{\n    \"reason\": \"your step by step reasoning here: \n...\n\",\n    \"plan\": \"(action1)\\n(action2)\\n(action3)...\"\n}\n$$\n\nMake sure your response follows this format exactly, with $$ markers at the beginning and end."
