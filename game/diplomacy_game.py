You are playing a game of Diplomacy against 6 opponents. Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers, or when all players agree to a draw. Taking an illegal move ends the game and the player who made the illegal move loses.
                                  
Diplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the "Spring" and "Fall" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by "retreat" or "disband" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.
                                  
Negotiation phase
In the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.
Communication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.

Movement phase
After the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a "convoy". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).
Certain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.

In the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:

1. Move
Units can be moved from one province to a neighboring province. The format is:

A [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)
F [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)
For example:

A BER-MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.
F NTH-ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).

2. Support
Units can choose to support the movement or garrison of another unit. The supported unit must be in the vicinity of the supported unit. The format is:

A [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)
A [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)
F [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)
F [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)
For example:

A BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.
A BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.

3. Support to Attack
Sometimes it is necessary to support another unit in an attack on a province. The format is:

A [province] S A [target province] - [attacked province]
For example:

A BER S A WAR-SIL means that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Warsaw in attacking Silesia.

4. Hold
Units can choose to stay in their current province and not move or support. The format is:

A [province] H (Army garrison)
F [province] H (Fleet garrison)
For example:

A BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.

5. Convoy (Occupation)
The fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:

F [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]
For example:

F ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).

6. Build
During the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.

For example:

Build A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.

7. Disband
Units may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.

The range of action space per turn
At each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.
                                  
End-of-year and supply centers
After each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw â€“ around half of all games will end in a draw.

You are playing as {index_power_name[i]}. The other players are playing as the following powers: {', '.join([index_power_name[j] for j in range(7) if j != i])}.
The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.

- "messages": (list(str)) the content of the messages that you would like to send.
The same index in the recipient list corresponds to the same index in the message list. The length of the recipients should be the same as messages.
